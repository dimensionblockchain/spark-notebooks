# spark-notebooks
A collection of my work in Scala using spylon kernel in jupyter notebooks through anaconda on Ubuntu 20.
I created a 4 core/default partitioned spark cluster w/ 14756MB RAM along with hive and yarn for resource manager. I created the cluster from scratch. I am using java 8/1.8 SE - Scala 2.11

I did this to not use spark-shell and have a better experience where I could work on on my Scala Spark projects.
I have been working on Scala FP for 2 years now. 

I lost my first VM with almost 2 years of work. 

I am hoping to recreate most of it.

I am using GitKraken for Git staging/push commits.
